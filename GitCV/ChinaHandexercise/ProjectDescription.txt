China Hand
PROJECT DESCRIPTION
---------------------------------
Rules of operation:

- Numeric cards can be played if the played card is higher in value than the previously played card  (except for "2" and "10")

- Picture cards can be played if the previous card is of value 7 or higher AND the played card is higher in value than the previously played card

- Aces are high

- If the player has multiple cards of the same value in hand, they can be played simultaneously

- "2" can be played on top of any card. Any card can be played on top of "2"

- "10" trumps the pile. Four (4) cards of the same value played on top of each other trump the pile. This grants a second turn.

- If player does not have a playable card, the pile is drawn

- Last hidden three (3) cards are only playable when the draw pile is empty and player's hand is empty. Hidden cards are drawn one at a time, unless a "2" or a "10" is drawn. In that case another hidden card can be drawn.

- Player with an empty hand and no remaining hidden cards wins
